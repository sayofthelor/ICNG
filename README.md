infinite campus notification grabber

my code sucks i know

to work it you need [node.js](https://nodejs.org) and the [infinite campus API](https://github.com/qwazwsx/infinite-campus)

you'll need to make a file called `credentials.txt` with the following things on four lines
```
district on line 1
state on line 2
username on line 3
password on line 4
```
